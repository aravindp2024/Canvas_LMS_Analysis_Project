## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of Canvas, the Learning Management System (LMS) used at Northeastern University. The research was aimed at evaluating the user experience for both students and faculty, identifying key pain points, and suggesting data-driven recommendations to improve the platform's usability. The insights were derived through a combination of qualitative and quantitative research, surveys, and user interviews.

## Objectives
The primary goals of this project were:
- To understand notable behaviors, preferences, and barriers impacting the usage of the Canvas platform.
- To identify needs and opportunities for enhancing the LMS experience for students and faculty.
- To observe the steps students currently take to complete tasks and find ways to optimize these processes.

## Research Goals
This project was initiated to help Northeastern University understand how effectively Canvas serves its academic community after transitioning from Blackboard. The research sought to:
- **Gather quantitative data** on usage patterns and preferences.
- **Collect qualitative feedback** on user experiences.
- **Analyze data** to provide actionable recommendations to improve Canvas's functionality and user experience.

### 1. Discovery Phase
- Conducted initial qualitative and quantitative research to understand the problem space.
- Created and distributed a survey to a broad base of students and faculty.
- Held stakeholder meetings to define research goals and expectations.

### 2. Define Phase
- Analyzed survey results to identify common patterns and preferences.
- Created user personas to represent diverse user groups.
- Developed user scenarios to capture typical interactions with Canvas.

### 3. Usability Testing
- Conducted remote usability tests with five participants to observe real-time interactions.
- Compiled feedback and insights to highlight critical usability issues.

## Tools Used
- **Figma**: For creating mockups and visual suggestions for UI improvements.
- **Google Docs**: For documentation and report creation.
- **Qualtrics**: For survey design and data collection.
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Google Slides**: For creating presentations to summarize findings.



## Key Deliverables

- Comprehensive data analysis of user survey responses.
- User personas created based on survey and interview data.
- Detailed findings report highlighting key pain points and user feedback.
- Recommendations for improving Canvas's interface and educational tools.
- Creation of Knowledge Base articles for better Canvas adoption.
- Presentation to Northeastern's leadership summarizing findings and recommendations.

## Data Analysis

### Data Collection
Data was collected through a survey consisting of 21 questions, receiving a total of 700 responses. The survey was designed to explore both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback on the use of Canvas by students and faculty members.

- **Usability Testing**: Identified critical areas for UI improvement, including simplifying access to assignments and grades, and enhancing the visibility of course materials.

## Business Analysis

### Pain Points
From the data gathered, several key challenges were identified:

- **Instructor Engagement**: Instructors were not fully utilizing Canvas's advanced features, leading to inconsistency in course layouts.
- **Navigation Complexity**: Students found the multi-click navigation to access key content cumbersome.
- **Module Management**: Feedback suggested that organizing modules chronologically would improve clarity.

### Recommendations

- **Training for Instructors**: Encourage a standardized layout using modules, with detailed guidance on using advanced Canvas features.
- **Interface Simplification**: Reduce the number of clicks needed to reach key content, including assignments, grades, and announcements.
- **Consistent Usage**: Ensure instructors are consistent in their use of Canvas tools to minimize confusion.
- **Knowledge Base Expansion**: Develop comprehensive articles and videos to guide both students and instructors in maximizing Canvas's functionality.

### Impact and Opportunities

- Improved user satisfaction by simplifying access to key content areas.
- Reduced frustration for students by encouraging consistent module organization.
- Opportunities for better engagement between faculty and students through the use of Canvas integrations.
- Potential for expanding Northeastern’s digital resources to include more self-service educational tools.

## Takeaways
The Canvas LMS research highlighted the importance of understanding user needs and how small interface changes can have a significant impact on user experience. This project not only strengthened skills in data analysis but also demonstrated the importance of a data-driven approach in UX research. Insights gathered from both qualitative and quantitative data provided a solid foundation for recommendations that can lead to meaningful improvements in Canvas’s functionality.
